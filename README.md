# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Reinforcement-Learning
This repository showcases a Tic Tac Toe game implemented using reinforcement learning techniques. The project aims to develop an AI agent that learns to play Tic Tac Toe optimally through self-play and reinforcement learning algorithms.

Features:
    Game Environment: A well-defined Tic Tac Toe game environment where the agent can interact and learn from its actions.
    Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: Implementation of algorithms such as Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to train the AI agent.
    Self-Play Training: The agent learns by playing against itself, improving its strategy over time based on the rewards received.
    Performance Visualization: Tools to visualize the learning process and performance of the agent over multiple training episodes.

Usage:
    Run the main script:
    python main.py
